SNMPD-Installer - v1.4 by devvis


I created this script when installing a new network management-tool
that used snmpd. Since I had like 20 servers to do all the configuration
on I thought that creating a script was the way to go.

Before putting it up for the public I made some enhancements, so you
can have interactive input or just an automated installation.

To get started, open up fixsnmpd.sh and edit the config-section,
and then chmod it so you can execute it (+x), and then just do like

./fixsnmpd.sh

and you should be all set.

I will probably add more configuration options and stuff like that
when the time is right.

One important thing is that this script contains the distro-script
provided by Observium, which is useful if you plan on using
Observium for network monitoring (then the scripts gives you a bit
more os-related info than snmpd does). Enable the installation of
the script by setting $observium to 1 in the script.
